**

## Simple lightweight broadcast skript!

**
**Download**: [here](https://github.com/iscrit/BetterBroadcast/releases/tag/Skript)



## What does it do?

 - Webhook Support (Allows you to connect your own webhook!) ðŸš¨
 - Customizable GUI (A gui that lets you broadcast the commands) ðŸŽ®
 - Better /broadcast comamnd! (More options with /broadcast)
 - Restore command ðŸ˜‡ (Lost control of your server? You can restore your op!)
 - Some moderaiton commands (My little teaser.)



## Keys

- We have a default key name ``Critcalthret`` set to verify your skript! Removing this key can tamper with the skripts security features we reccomend you turn off advanced logging instead of changing the key!
